Represents a caption for an item in a user interface.

It can be associated with a control either by placing the control element
*inside* the label element, **or** by using the `for` attribute. Such a control
is called the *labeled control* of the label element.

‚ö†Ô∏è This is the most important element if you want to build *accessible* forms ‚Äî
when implemented properly, screenreaders will speak a form element‚Äôs label
along with any related instructions.

### üëç Best Practices

- Resist using placeholder text as labels as this causes many usability issues.
- Use succinct, short and descriptive labels (a word or two) so users can quickly scan your form.
- Users complete top aligned labeled forms at a much higher rate than left aligned labels.
- ‚ÄúAll Caps‚Äù labels are very hard to read.

```html
<div class="form-text">
    <label class="label form-label" for="my-input">
        <span class="label">Label</span>
        <span class="hint">Hint or instruction</span>
    </label>
    <input class="input" type="text" id="my-input" name="my-input">
</div>
```
